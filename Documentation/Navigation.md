## Navigating the code

*this section is still under construction*

ZuraTDD *setup* and *expect* objects are not the mocked interfaces themselves. Navigating to their method definitions will not lead directly to the mocked method. In most places the generated code includes codedoc which links to the exact method. If you find places where these links are missing or broken - please create an issue.
